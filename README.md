# Weather and Soil Index-Based Crop Insurance using Regression Analysis and EWM-TOPSIS

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for the research project, **"Weather and Soil Index Based Crop Insurance using Regression Analysis and EWM-TOPSIS"**.  
The study proposes a novel weather and soil index-based crop insurance scheme for wheat in three Indian states: **Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar**.  

By integrating key weather and soil variables, the model develops **state-specific insurance contracts** designed to minimize basis risk and provide more accurate compensation to farmers.

## Key Features
- **State-Specific Models**: Develops unique insurance contracts for West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar based on their specific agricultural risks.  
- **Multi-Factor Index**: Incorporates rainfall, temperature, NPK consumption, and net irrigated area into a robust insurance index.  
- **Hybrid Methodology**: Combines regression analysis (to identify key risk factors) with **EWM-TOPSIS** (to validate and assign objective weights).  
- **Data-Driven Design**: Reduces **basis risk** (when farmers suffer losses but don’t get payouts) by ensuring the index is strongly correlated with actual yield losses.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Historical data (2005–2024) for wheat yield, rainfall, temperature, NPK consumption, and irrigated area.  
   - Wheat yields detrended using **robust regression (Bisquare & Huber)** to remove time influence.  

2. **Regression Analysis**  
   - Detrended yields regressed on weather and soil variables.  
   - Identified the most significant factors per state.  

3. **EWM-TOPSIS Validation**  
   - **Entropy Weight Method (EWM)** → objective weights from variability.  
   - **TOPSIS** → ranked years by risk, validating selected indices.  

4. **Insurance Contract Design**  
   - State-specific indemnity contracts with triggers, exit levels, and payouts.  
   - **Pure Premium Rates (PPR)** calculated for fair premiums.

## Results
The analysis identified the most critical factors for each state:

- **West Bengal**: Rainfall + Net Irrigated Area → PPR: **3.48%**  
- **Uttar Pradesh**: Temperature + Rainfall → PPR: **5.68%**  
- **Bihar**: Net Irrigated Area + NPK Consumption → PPR: **7.64%**

## Future Goals
- Extend framework to **other crops & regions**.  
- Integrate **real-time satellite and sensor data**.  
- Use **ARIMA models** for forecasting risks.  
- Compute **net premium** with risk loading + admin costs.
